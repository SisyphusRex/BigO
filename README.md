This is my solution to an algorithmic problem and excercise in program efficiency.

I am following along with the following video:

To show program efficiency, we are to solve this problem two different ways and compare
the "speed" of the solvers

For nonnegative integers n, a, b, c
find all sets (a, b, c) where n = a + b + c

To test the different algorithms with machine independence, I am not timing
the speed to a solution but the amount of iterations to a solution.
